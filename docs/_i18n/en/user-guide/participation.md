# Manage Participation

Once you selected a kind of sport for each participant. You're ready to
start the competition.

![note]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/user-guide/note-graphic.png) Every participant which participates in the sport 'Athletics' will become a competitor for the competition

First of all you need to close the participation.

![close participation]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/user-guide/close-participation.png){: .img-fluid}

This action will create a start number for each competitor.

![note]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/user-guide/note-graphic.jpg) In case you forgot to select a kind of sport for a participant, this overview will tell you which group(s) they belong to.

![warning]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/user-guide/warning-graphic.png) Do only close the participation if you're sure every participant has select the correct kind of sport.
This action will disable the sport selection in the group detail page

## Re-participate after the participation is closed

Once you close the participation, the sport selection in the group detail page will be disabled.
However, you still can change the kind of sport with a special action.

![re-participate]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/user-guide/re-participate.png){: .img-fluid}

This action will enable the sport selection for exactly the selected participant.

![note]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/user-guide/note-graphic.jpg) You can add a new participant at any time. It does not matter if the participation is open or already closed.

## Reset the sport event

PSA is design to only manage one sport event at the same time. If you want to make a new sport event
you have to reset the sport event as a whole. That means that all participant data
will be lost.

![reset-participation]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/user-guide/reset-participation.png){: .img-fluid}

![note]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/user-guide/note-graphic.jpg) PSA can not store more than one sport event at the same time.

![warning]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/user-guide/warning-graphic.png) All participant data will be lost in the process.
