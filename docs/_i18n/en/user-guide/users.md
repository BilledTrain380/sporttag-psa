# Manage Users

You can add additional users, so they can record competitor results.

All users have only access to the result page. Therefore their primary usage
is to record the results of the competitors.

## Add User

![add user]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/img/user-guide/users/add-user.png){: .img-fluid}

This action will open a dialog to add a new user.

## Delete User

![delete user]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/img/user-guide/users/delete-user.png){: .img-fluid}

This action will delete the user.

## Change User Password

![change pw]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/img/user-guide/users/change-user-pw.png){: .img-fluid}

This action will open a dialog to change the password from the specific user.

## Disable User

You can disable a user. A disabled user is still available, but he can not sign in while
he is disabled.

Simply check or uncheck the enabled checkbox.
