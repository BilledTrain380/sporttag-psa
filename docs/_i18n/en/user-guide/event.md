# Event Sheets

Simply export PDF files that give you an overview of all your participants.

You have different kind of files:
* Participant List - A list of each participant per kind of sport (expect athletics).
* Event Sheets - To write down the results on paper

![event]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/img/user-guide/event/event.png){: .img-fluid}

![note]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/img/user-guide/note-graphic.png) You can use the web interface directly, so you don't have to print the event sheets.

![note]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/img/user-guide/note-graphic.png) The export can take a while. It will be indicated through a spinner on the button. Once the files are generated, it'll be downloaded automatically.
