# About

PSA was originally developed for Primarschule Altendorf. Because it is a Open Source licensed project,
I decided to extend it more and more to a general use for a sport event management system. This way also clubs
or other schools can use it.

The use of PSA will be as easy as possible. Because of that, there is a macOS and Windows native app with
a minimal administration GUI available. As a result people with maybe not the required computer knowledge
of command line are able to use it.

PSA is completely free to use. I develop it in my free time. Because of this reasons, unfortunately I
can not guarantee a continuous development of PSA.
